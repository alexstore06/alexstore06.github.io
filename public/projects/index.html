<ul>
<li>Linux from Scratch (LFS)</li>

<p>This was an excellent learning experience. Building a Linux system from the ground up gave me huge appreciation for how much work individual distributions put into dealing with the quirks of every single package that make up a Linux system.</p>

<ul>
<li>NAND to Tetris</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;ve just started this course recently, but I&rsquo;m enjoying it immensely. It covers the full computational stack: logic gates, architecture, machine code, operating systems, and compilers. With its additional heavy coverage of HDLs (hardware description languages), it even interfaces with the topics I&rsquo;m covering in my Computer Engineering degree.</p>
<ul>
<li>Physics 3 (OpenStax)</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been studying optics on my own recently, so I&rsquo;m reading this textbook in preperation for a Modern Physics class that I plan to take soon. It unfortunately doesn&rsquo;t count for elective credit, but it will be enlightening all the same.</p>
<ul>
<li>CompTIA CySA+</li>
</ul>
<p>The CySA+ will be my next major certification. I&rsquo;ve been studying cybersecurity in a competition environment for some time now, so I&rsquo;m feeling confident about it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Basys3 FPGA</li>
</ul>
<p>I bought this FPGA board recently to do some experimentation. I&rsquo;m hoping to learn a lot about FPGAs and logic design over the coming months.</p>
