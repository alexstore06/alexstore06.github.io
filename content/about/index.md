Hello! I'm Alex Weir, a community college student aiming for a Bachelor's in Computer Engineering.

I love tech and have basic skills in a reasonably wide range of platforms and technologies, but I have excellent Googling skills and can figure out anything in a pinch. Though I don't have a degree (or even a diploma, yet), I have a number of certifications, and my collection of them is always growing.
