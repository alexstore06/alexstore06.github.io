Hello! I'm Alex Weir, a Liberty University student graduating in 2028 with a Bachelor's in Computer Engineering.

I love tech, engineering, and physics and have particular skills in computer networking, having studied it for a number of years now. I have a considerable and growing collection of certifications to demonstrate my broad range of IT, networking, and security knowledge.

I'm also on the Liberty University Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition (CCDC) team, focusing on Linux and network enumeration.

Though I'm not quite out of college, I'm studying cross-discipline engineering topics heavily on my own and plan to take many Mechanical Engineering classes over my time at Liberty.

Please check out my resume and reach out! I'd love to connect. Contact information is on the links on the front page or in my resume.
