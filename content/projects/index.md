title: Projects, etc

I'm studying and working on a number of projects all of the time. If you have any insights into these, let me know! I'm particularly interested in computer, electrical, and mechanical engineering topics.

## Current Projects

- Linux from Scratch (LFS)

I've been working on this for a while, and I'm almost done. Building a Linux system from the ground up has given me huge appreciation for how much work individual distributions put into dealing with the quirks of every single package that make up a Linux system.

- NAND to Tetris

I've just started this course recently, but I'm enjoying it immensely. It covers the full computational stack: logic gates, architecture, machine code, operating systems, and compilers. With its additional heavy coverage of HDLs (hardware description languages), it even interfaces with the topics I'm covering in my Computer Engineering degree.

- Physics 3 (OpenStax)

I've been studying optics on my own recently, so I'm reading this textbook in preperation for a Modern Physics class that I plan to take soon. It unfortunately doesn't count for elective credit, but it will be enlightening all the same.

- CompTIA CySA+

The CySA+ will be my next major certification. I've been studying cybersecurity in a competition environment for some time now, so I'm feeling confident about it.

## Classes taken outside of program
